# Contributing

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development workflow

To get started with the project, please install a few pre-requisites: [ninja](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ninja) & [premake5](https://premake.github.io/). [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/) will install both [git-lfs](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git-lfs) and ninja, for premake5 you will need to download the binary, and make sure its available on your path. Moving the executable to `/usr/local/bin/` will work.

Check out this repository, making sure to include the submodules. It is important to use ssh to checkout this repo, as the submodules are linked via ssh.

`git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:rive-app/rive-ios.git`

The package relies on [Skia](https://skia.org/), as well as [rive-cpp](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-cpp) in order to be built. To shorten the build cycle, we rely on compiled libraries for skia, rive & rive-skia-renderer.
The `./scripts/build.sh all` script will download or build appropriate libraries, be sure to run configure when making changes to our rive-cpp submodule.

Rive is constantly making use of the latest clang features, so please ensure your Xcode and Xcode Command Line Tools are up to date with the latest versions.

## Targets / Schemes

The example app has different targets/schemes. The `example` targets make use of the local Rive dependency and the `preview` targets make use of a hosted version of Rive - to make it easy to run without needing to do all of the local development setup. If you're making changes to the underlying Rive package and need to test the example app, be sure to set the target/scheme to `example`. See [Customizing the build schemes for a project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project) for more information.

## Releasing

After releasing a new Rive runtime version you'll need to manually update the Rive dependency for the `preview` targets. This is to ensure that anyone evaluating Rive is using the latest hosted version. Right click the `RiveRuntime` dependency in the inspector and select `Update Package`. If there is a major version bump it will need to be configured in the project settings, by updating the minimum version in the `Package Dependencies` section for the `RiveExample` project.

### Uploading caches

If you are contributing and you have access to Rives' AWS environment, make you sure install `aws-cli` and configure it with your credentials. If you run into permission issues here `aws sts get-caller-identity` can help make sure that your local developer environment is setup to talk to AWS correctly.
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

Note: on a Mac with brew, you can simply run 'brew install awscli'

Note: the 'dependencies' directory is just a cache of what the configure.sh script downloads. It can be removed if you suspect it is out of date, and then just rerun the script (./scripts/configure.sh)

### Changing rive-cpp/skia

Changes within the rive-ios should just be reflected when you make builds.
If you make changes within the `rive-cpp` submodule you will need to compile the prebuilt libraries, this can take a reasonably long time, but as long as you are working on rive-cpp with no uncommitted changes, it will fall back to using the cache, so you will only need to build once.

### Testing changes

In addition to tests in the project, you may want to visually test out any changes by running the `Example-iOS` app at the top-level. Open the `RiveExample.xcodeproj` project in XCode. Make sure you have the local build of iOS run before testing out this application. Feel free to bring in additional Rives to the `assets/` folder. Ensure you add the Rive to the targets by checking the checkbox "Add to targets: RiveExample" when dragging assets into the folder so it can be properly included in the assets bundle and referenced accordingly in the example app.

### Linting and tests

- We currently do not have any automatic linting set up.
- Tests are run on pull request, and you should be able to run tests via xcode in the `RiveRuntime` project.

## Scripts

The `scripts` folder contains a few scripts to manage dependencies and perform builds.

## FAQ

### `Rive.h` file not found

This is probably because of missing submodules. Make sure you check out rive with [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

### `rive/renderer.hpp` file not found

This is likely because the `script/configure.py` has not been run yet.
