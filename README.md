## Rive overview

[Rive](https://rive.app) is a real-time interactive design and animation tool that helps teams create and run interactive animations anywhere. Designers and developers use our collaborative editor to create motion graphics that respond to different states and user inputs. Our lightweight open-source runtime libraries allow them to load their animations into apps, games, and websites.

## Supported devices

Currently, this runtime library supports a minimum iOS version of **14.0+**. Devices supported include iPhone, iPad, and Mac catalyst. macOS support supports a targeted version of **13.1**.

## Examples

Check out the `Example-iOS/` folder for an example application using the Rive iOS/macOS runtime.

Open the project in XCode and ensure the selected scheme/target is set to `Preview`/`Preview (macOS)`. These schemes make use of the hosted Rive package dependency. The other targets are for local development and require additional configuration and set-up. See [Customizing the build schemes for a project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project) for instructions to switch schemes, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more information.

The example showcases a number of ways to use the high-level `RiveViewModel` API through UIKit and SwiftUI examples, including:

- Setting a Rive file via a URL or asset in the bundle
- Setting layout and loop mode options
- Displaying single or multiple animations / artboards on one component
- Setting up and maniuplating a state machine via inputs
- ...and more!
